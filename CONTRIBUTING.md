Hi! I'm not too sure on what to put here so here are some contributing rules:
1. Make sure its a useful contribution
2. Make sure its not malicious
3. Test it before submission
4. I may decline merge requests, this is usually because either
one of the mentioned rules weren't followed, or because it doesn't match
the projects direction in development/purpose


One of the most useful things you can do is submit your ro. dumps, this allows the project
to support more android versions/manufacturers/flavours!
It collects your hardware info, date and time, software info and country through
use of your sim card, so if you don't wish to share those you may delete them from
the output, or remove your simcard before running it.
The file is found at the root of the github repo

Submit them in the discussions tab! https://github.com/FastCocobo/AndroidFetch/discussions
